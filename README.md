### End-to-end Distributed ML using AWS EMR, Apache Spark (Pyspark) and MongoDB Tutorial with MillionSongs Data

In this repo you will find easy to use scripts in order to run machine learning models in Pyspark while using MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
Even though scripts can be ran locally it is highly encouraged to set up an AWS EMR instance in order to work with this amount of data easier and use Spark workers to distribute the processes.

Here is a blog post for anyone looking for guidance, [medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/end-to-end-distributed-ml-using-aws-emr-apache-spark-pyspark-and-mongodb-tutorial-with-4d1077f68381).
I personally enjoyed very much working on this type and amount of data, hope you will find it interesting too!
